# Backend Application

This is a placeholder for a future flask application that would be sitting behind a reverse 
proxy to serve Machine Learning predictions for future projects.

For now, a simple flask application is put in place to accept `POST` requests and to return
some data. This will enable infrastructure work of piping a request from the frontend to
the backend, and returning some data to the frontend service.
